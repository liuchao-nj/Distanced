# Distanced
Distanced is a bioinformatics tool that accurately estimates diversity of ribosomal DNA sequences within microbial communities.  Estimating diversity has been a perreniel challenge because sequencing error creates artefactual sequences and inflates diversity.  Distanced overcomes this problem by correcting values of mean pairwise distance, a measure of within-sample diversity, for the expected increase after sequencing.

# Distanced
Distanced is a bioinformatics tool that accurately estimates diversity of ribosomal DNA sequences within microbial communities.  Sequencing error creates artefactual sequences and inflates estimates of diversity.  Distanced accurately estimates mean pairwise distance, a measure of within-sample diversity, by correcting sequence distances for the expected increase after sequencing.
